    }
  }
}
```

## Decision Engine Integration

### Multi-Criteria Assessment
The enhanced decision engine evaluates diversion options using:

1. **Airport Suitability Scoring**
   - Runway length compatibility
   - Medical facility availability
   - Fuel service capabilities
   - Operating hours coverage

2. **Emergency Readiness Classification**
   - `full_capability`: 24/7 medical and emergency services
   - `medical_available`: Medical facilities with limited hours
   - `basic`: Standard airport services only

3. **Aircraft-Specific Analysis**
   - Runway length requirements by aircraft type
   - Fuel consumption calculations
   - Approach complexity assessment

4. **Operational Impact Modeling**
   - Time delay estimations
   - Financial cost projections
   - Passenger welfare considerations

### Virgin Atlantic Fleet Compatibility

#### Aircraft-Specific Requirements
```typescript
const runwayRequirements = {
  'Boeing 787-9': 2500,      // meters minimum
  'Airbus A350-1000': 2700,
  'Airbus A330-900': 2400,
  'Airbus A330-300': 2500
};

const fuelConsumption = {
  'Boeing 787-9': 2400,      // kg base consumption
  'Airbus A350-1000': 2600,
  'Airbus A330-900': 2200,
  'Airbus A330-300': 2300
