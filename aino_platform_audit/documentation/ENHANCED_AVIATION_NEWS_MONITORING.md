## Advanced Scoring Algorithm

### Relevance Score Calculation

```typescript
// Primary scoring method
private calculateRelevanceScore(text: string): { [key: string]: number } {
  const textLower = text.toLowerCase();
  const scores: { [key: string]: number } = {};

  for (const [category, keywords] of Object.entries(this.keywords)) {
    let score = 0;
    
    for (const keyword of keywords) {
      // Exact phrase matches (weight: 3x)
      if (textLower.includes(keyword.toLowerCase())) {
        const occurrences = (textLower.match(new RegExp(keyword.toLowerCase(), 'g')) || []).length;
        score += occurrences * 3;
      }
      
      // Word boundary matches (weight: 1x)
      const words = keyword.toLowerCase().split(' ');
      for (const word of words) {
        if (word.length > 3) {
          const wordRegex = new RegExp(`\\b${word}\\b`, 'gi');
          const wordMatches = (textLower.match(wordRegex) || []).length;
          score += wordMatches;
        }
      }
    }
    
    scores[category] = score;
  }

  return scores;
}
```

### Relevance Thresholds
- **Critical**: Total score ≥ 15 (immediate attention required)
- **High**: Total score ≥ 8 (significant operational impact)
- **Medium**: Total score ≥ 3 (monitoring recommended)
- **Low**: Total score < 3 (general awareness)
