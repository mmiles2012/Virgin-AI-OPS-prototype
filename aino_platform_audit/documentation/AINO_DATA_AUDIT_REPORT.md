## ‚ùå SYNTHETIC/SIMULATED DATA REQUIRING REPLACEMENT

### 1. Flight Tracking & Positions ‚ùå SIMULATED
**Current Issue:** All aircraft positions are algorithmically generated
```typescript
// Flight positions are calculated, not real
latitude: baseLatitude + (progress * latDiff)
longitude: baseLongitude + (progress * lonDiff)
```
**Impact:** 40 Virgin Atlantic aircraft showing fake positions
**Solution Needed:** Real-time flight tracking API integration

### 2. Virgin Atlantic Fleet Operations ‚ùå SIMULATED
**Current Issue:** Flight schedules and operational data are generated
```typescript
// Simulated schedule generation
private generateEnhancedNetworkData(): void {
  const authenticRoutes = [
    // These routes are real, but timing/status is simulated
  ]
}
```
**Impact:** All flight statuses, delays, and operational metrics are fake
**Solution Needed:** Virgin Atlantic API integration or FlightAware partnership

### 3. Passenger Connection Data ‚ùå SIMULATED
**Current Issue:** All passenger names and connection scenarios are fake
```typescript
// Fake passenger data
{ name: "Hans Mueller", connection: "VS103‚ÜíAF1234" }
```
**Impact:** Connection monitoring shows simulated passengers
**Solution Needed:** Real passenger data feed (requires airline partnership)

### 4. Aircraft Digital Twin Data ‚ùå MIXED
**Current Issue:** Performance calculations use real specifications but simulated operational data
- ‚úÖ Aircraft specifications are authentic (Boeing 787-9, A350-1000)
- ‚ùå Real-time performance metrics are calculated, not measured
**Solution Needed:** Aircraft telemetry integration
