## Quick Start Guide

### TRI Command Centre Access
1. **Enhanced Dashboard**: Run `streamlit run enhanced_tri_command_centre.py --server.port 8502`
2. **Basic Dashboard**: Run `streamlit run streamlit_tri_command_centre.py --server.port 8501`

### Key Capabilities
- **Live Data Integration**: ADS-B Exchange flight tracking + AVWX weather data
- **Connection Risk Assessment**: MCT analysis with enhanced risk categorization
- **Weather-Adjusted Calculations**: Automatic fuel penalty adjustments
- **Multi-Factor Risk Synthesis**: Fuel, connections, crew, and diversion analysis

### Risk Categories
- **Missed**: Gap < MCT → "Rebook and notify OCC"
- **Tight**: Gap < MCT + 15min → "Priority transfer or stand coordination"
- **Safe**: Gap ≥ MCT + 15min → "No action needed"

## System Architecture

### Live Data Sources
- **ADS-B Exchange**: Real-time Virgin Atlantic flight positions (15+ aircraft tracked)
- **AVWX Weather API**: METAR/TAF data with 30-minute update cycles
- **FlightAware**: ETA predictions and schedule intelligence
- **Connection Database**: Real-time passenger tracking

### Destination-Specific MCT Analysis
- **JFK**: 45 minutes minimum connection time
- **ATL**: 50 minutes minimum connection time  
- **BOS**: 40 minutes minimum connection time

### TRI Analysis Example (VS3)
```
Flight: VS3 (LHR-JFK)
Connection Risk: 18 at-risk passengers across SkyTeam connections
Fuel Analysis: $340 potential savings vs $2,700 connection costs
Recommendation: "MAINTAIN: Current operation optimal - Risk outweighs savings"
Priority: HIGH risk classification requiring immediate assessment
```
