### 3. Intelligence Processing

#### Article Categorization
Each news article is automatically classified into:
- **Category**: geopolitical, aviation, economic, security
- **Risk Relevance**: high, medium, low
- **Affected Regions**: Geographic impact assessment
- **Keywords**: Extracted threat indicators

#### Risk Factor Generation
```javascript
// Example risk factor structure
{
  category: "Political Instability",
  impact: "high",
  description: "Government crisis affecting air traffic control",
  source: "Reuters",
  lastUpdated: "2025-01-20T10:15:00Z"
}
```
