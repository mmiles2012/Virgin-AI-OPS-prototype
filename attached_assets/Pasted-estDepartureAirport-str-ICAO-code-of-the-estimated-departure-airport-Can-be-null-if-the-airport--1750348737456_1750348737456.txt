estDepartureAirport: str - ICAO code of the estimated departure airport. Can be null if the airport could not be identified.
lastSeen: int - Estimated time of arrival for the flight as Unix time (seconds since epoch).
estArrivalAirport: str - ICAO code of the estimated arrival airport. Can be null if the airport could not be identified.
callsign: str - Callsign of the vehicle (8 chars). Can be null if no callsign has been received. If the vehicle transmits multiple callsigns during the flight, we take the one seen most frequently.
estDepartureAirportHorizDistance: int - Horizontal distance of the last received airborne position to the estimated departure airport in meters.
estDepartureAirportVertDistance: int - Vertical distance of the last received airborne position to the estimated departure airport in meters.
estArrivalAirportHorizDistance: int - Horizontal distance of the last received airborne position to the estimated arrival airport in meters.
estArrivalAirportVertDistance: int - Vertical distance of the last received airborne position to the estimated arrival airport in meters.
departureAirportCandidatesCount: int - Number of other possible departure airports. These are airports in short distance to estDepartureAirport.
arrivalAirportCandidatesCount: int - Number of other possible departure airports.
These are airports in short distance to estArrivalAirport.
class opensky_api.Waypoint(arr)¶
Class that represents the single waypoint that is a basic part of flight trajectory:

time: int - Time which the given waypoint is associated with in seconds since epoch (Unix time).
latitude: float - WGS-84 latitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.
longitude: float - WGS-84 longitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.
baro_altitude: float - Barometric altitude in meters. Can be null.
true_track: float - True track in decimal degrees clockwise from north (north=0°). Can be null.
on_ground: bool - Boolean value which indicates if the position was retrieved from a surface position report.
class opensky_api.FlightTrack(arr)¶
Class that represents the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time.:

icao24: str - Unique ICAO 24-bit address of the transponder in lower case hex string representation.
startTime: int - Time of the first waypoint in seconds since epoch (Unix time).
endTime: int - Time of the last waypoint in seconds since epoch (Unix time).
