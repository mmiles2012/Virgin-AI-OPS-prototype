# Real-Time Location Display with Airports

Create a web application that displays real-time location data on an interactive map with airport markers. The application should include:

## Core Features:
- **Interactive Map**: Use Google Maps API, Mapbox, or Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- **Real-time Location**: Display user's current GPS coordinates with live updates
- **Airport Data**: Show nearby airports with custom markers/icons
- **Flight Tracking**: Real-time Virgin Atlantic flight positions and status
- **Location Services**: Request and handle geolocation permissions

## Technical Requirements:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla or framework of choice)
- **Map Integration**: 
  - Google Maps JavaScript API, OR
  - Mapbox GL JS, OR  
  - Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Airport Data**: Use aviation APIs like:
  - AviationStack API
  - OpenSky Network API
  - FlightAware API
  - Or static airport dataset (GeoJSON)
- **Flight Tracking APIs**: 
  - OpenSky Network (free, real-time flight positions)
  - FlightAware API (comprehensive flight data)
  - AviationStack API (flight status and tracking)
  - FlightRadar24 API (if available)
- **Virgin Atlantic Specific**: Filter flights by airline code "VS" or "VIR"
- **Geolocation**: HTML5 Geolocation API with error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Key Functionality:
1. **Location Tracking**: Auto-update user position every 5-10 seconds
2. **Airport Display**: Show airports within configurable radius (e.g., 50km)
3. **Virgin Atlantic Flight Tracking**:
   - Display all active Virgin Atlantic flights on map
   - Show flight paths, current positions, and aircraft icons
   - Flight details: flight number, aircraft type, altitude, speed
   - Origin/destination airports and estimated arrival times
   - Real-time updates every 30-60 seconds
4. **Airport Info**: Display airport codes, names, and distances on click/hover
5. **Map Controls**: Zoom, pan, layer toggles, center on user location
6. **Flight Filtering**: Toggle Virgin Atlantic flights on/off
7. **Permission Handling**: Graceful fallback if location access denied

## UI Elements:
- Current coordinates display (lat/lng)
- Distance to nearest airport
- **Virgin Atlantic Flight Panel**:
  - List of active flights with status
  - Selected flight details (click on aircraft)
  - Flight progress indicator
- Search functionality for specific locations
- Toggle for airport visibility
- Toggle for Virgin Atlantic flight tracking
- Location accuracy indicator
- Flight information popup/sidebar

## File Structure:
```
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
├── flight-tracker.js (Virgin Atlantic flight handling)
├── airports.json (if using static data)
└── README.md
```

## Implementation Notes:
- **Virgin Atlantic ICAO Code**: "VIR" or IATA Code: "VS"
- **Flight Data Updates**: Implement efficient polling to avoid API rate limits
- **Aircraft Icons**: Use different icons for different aircraft types
- **Flight Paths**: Draw routes between origin/destination airports
- **Performance**: Consider using flight data caching for better performance

Please include error handling for geolocation failures, API rate limits, and flight data unavailability. Make the interface clean and intuitive for tracking both personal location and Virgin Atlantic fleet positions simultaneously.
