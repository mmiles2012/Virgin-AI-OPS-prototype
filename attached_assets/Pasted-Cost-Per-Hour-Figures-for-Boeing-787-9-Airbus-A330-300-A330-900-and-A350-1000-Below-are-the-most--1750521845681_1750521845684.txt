Below are the most accurate and recent estimates for the direct operating cost per flight hour for each aircraft, based on available industry data and sources.
Boeing 787-9
	•	Estimated Operating Cost per Hour:
	•	$7,184 (industry average, includes fuel, crew, maintenance, ownership)
	•	Charter/VIP rental rates are much higher at $30,950 per hour, but this is not representative of airline operating cost.
	•	Context:

Airbus A330-300
	•	Estimated Operating Cost per Hour:
	•	$7,827 (industry average, includes fuel, crew, maintenance, ownership)
	•	Charter rates are also listed at $30,950 per hour, but this is not an airline operating cost.
	•	Context:
	•	The A330-300’s cost is slightly higher than the 787-9, reflecting its older design and less efficient engines compared to newer models.
Airbus A330-900 (A330neo)
	•	Estimated Operating Cost per Hour:
	•	Fuel cost: ~€4,067 per hour (about $4,400 at current exchange rates)
	•	Crew cost: €1,950 per hour (about $2,100)

	•	Context:
	•	The A330-900 has improved efficiency over the A330-300, but real-world average costs are in the $8,000–$9,500 per hour range, depending on utilization and airline contracts.
Airbus A350-1000
	•	Estimated Operating Cost per Hour:
	•	$9,000–$9,500 per hour (industry estimate, includes fuel, crew, maintenance, depreciation)
	•	Independent analysis suggests a similar figure, with detailed breakdowns of fuel, crew, and ownership costs.
	•	Context:
	•	The A350-1000 is one of the most efficient long-haul aircraft, but its size and advanced systems mean higher absolute hourly costs compared to smaller widebodies.
