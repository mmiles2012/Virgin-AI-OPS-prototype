Looking at your satellite background code, I can see you're using Mapbox's Static Images API. Here's my audit with observations and recommendations:

## Current Implementation Analysis

**What's Working:**
- Clean JSX structure with conditional rendering
- Proper token validation
- Responsive sizing with `inset-0` and `w-full h-full`
- High-resolution imagery with `@2x`
- Transform scaling for zoom effect

## Issues & Concerns

### 1. **API Rate Limits & Caching**
```javascript
// Problem: New API call on every render/zoom change
backgroundImage: `url("https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/${mapCenter.lon},${mapCenter.lat},${Math.max(0, Math.min(zoomLevel, 8))}/1200x800@2x?access_token=${mapboxToken}")`
```
This creates a new API request every time `mapCenter` or `zoomLevel` changes, which could quickly exhaust your API quota.

### 2. **Performance Issues**
- **Image Loading**: No loading states or error handling
- **Memory Leaks**: Images aren't being cleaned up
- **Scaling Artifacts**: CSS transforms on large images can be janky

### 3. **Limited Zoom Constraint**
```javascript
Math.max(0, Math.min(zoomLevel, 8))
```
Capping zoom at level 8 might not provide enough detail for close-up views.

## Recommended Improvements## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **API Optimization**
- **Debouncing**: 300ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Coordinate Rounding**: Reduces unique URLs by rounding coordinates
- **Image Caching**: Prevents re-downloading the same images
- **Preloading**: Images load in background before display

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while images load
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when images fail
- **Smooth Transitions**: Opacity transitions between states
- **Fallback Background**: Gradient background when no image available

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Memory Management**: Clears image cache on unmount
- **Transform Optimization**: More efficient scaling calculations
- **Animation Controls**: Toggle movement on/off

### 4. **Better Movement Animation**
- Continuous subtle movement instead of just scaling
- Configurable animation speed
- Proper cleanup of intervals

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider Mapbox GL JS**: For more dynamic satellite imagery with better performance
2. **Implement Tile-based Loading**: For smoother zooming and panning
3. **Add Retry Logic**: For failed API requests
4. **Monitor API Usage**: Track requests to avoid quota limits
5. **Optimize Image Sizes**: Use different resolutions based on viewport size

The improved version should give you much better performance and user experience while being more robust and maintainable!
