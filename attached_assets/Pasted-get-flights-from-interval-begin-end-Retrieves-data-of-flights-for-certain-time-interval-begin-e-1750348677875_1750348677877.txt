get_flights_from_interval(begin, end)¶
Retrieves data of flights for certain time interval [begin, end].

Parameters
:
begin (int) – Start of time interval to retrieve flights for as Unix time (seconds since epoch).
end (int) – End of time interval to retrieve flights for as Unix time (seconds since epoch).
Returns
:
list of FlightData objects if request was successful, None otherwise.
Return type
:
FlightData | None
get_my_states(time_secs=0, icao24=None, serials=None)¶
Retrieve state vectors for your own sensors. Authentication is required for this operation. If time = 0 the most recent ones are taken. Optional filters may be applied for ICAO24 addresses and sensor serial numbers.

Parameters
:
time_secs (int) – time as Unix time stamp (seconds since epoch) or datetime. The datetime must be in UTC!
icao24 (str) – optionally retrieve only state vectors for the given ICAO24 address(es). The parameter can either be a single address as str or an array of str containing multiple addresses.
serials (int) – optionally retrieve only states of vehicles as seen by the given sensor(s). The parameter can either be a single sensor serial number (int) or a list of serial numbers.
Returns
:
OpenSkyStates if request was successful, None otherwise.
Return type
:
OpenSkyStates | None
get_states(time_secs=0, icao24=None, bbox=())¶
Retrieve state vectors for a given time. If time = 0 the most recent ones are taken. Optional filters may be applied for ICAO24 addresses.

Parameters
:
time_secs (int) – time as Unix time stamp (seconds since epoch) or datetime. The datetime must be in UTC!
icao24 (str) – optionally retrieve only state vectors for the given ICAO24 address(es). The parameter can either be a single address as str or an array of str containing multiple addresses.
bbox (tuple) – optionally retrieve state vectors within a bounding box. The bbox must be a tuple of exactly four values [min_latitude, max_latitude, min_longitude, max_longitude] each in WGS84 decimal degrees.
Returns
:
OpenSkyStates if request was successful, None otherwise.
Return type
:
OpenSkyStates | None
get_track_by_aircraft(icao24, t=0)¶
Retrieve the trajectory for a certain aircraft at a given time. The tracks endpoint is purely experimental.

Parameters
:
icao24 (str) – Unique ICAO 24-bit address of the transponder in hex string representation. All letters need to be lower case.
t (int) – Unix time in seconds since epoch. It can be any time between start and end of a known flight. If time = 0, get the live track if there is any flight ongoing for the given aircraft.
Returns
:
FlightTrack object if request was successful, None otherwise.
Return type
:
FlightTrack | None
